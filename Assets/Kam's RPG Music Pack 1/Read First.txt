Thank you for downloading my RPG Game Music Pack! This pack contains 7 tracks (WAV & MP3 files) fully made by me. The art itself was made by my good friend Arrison! Her twitter handle is @ArrisonTalion. My music packs are sold on Unity, GameDev Market, and Itch.io (if things go as planned).If you search KameronGuajardoVGM, you should be able to find me in any of the stores.
I hope my tracks serve your game well! No need for credit or purchase of license to use in commercial game. 
If you have any questions, concerns, or would like to hire me to compose custom music for your game, reach me at Kameronguajardovgm@gmail.com

Wishes you the best,
Kameron Guajardo
